Description
-----------
  rockmarble is a MeeGo app that allows you to find good live music.
  You can either follow your favourite artists or find new ones.

  Everything started as a simple Qt app that has been later ported to MeeGo.
  You can find the old app inside of the old_user_interface branch.

Have fun,
Flavio
